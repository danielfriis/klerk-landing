title: Introducing Heyday
---

Today we're announcing Heyday — a personal AI therapist and coach aimed at addressing the escalating global mental health crisis.

## The Mental Health Crisis

During the pandemic, the world saw a substantial increase in the number of cases of mental health disorders. Depression cases surged 28% from about 193 million to 246 million cases globally, and anxiety disorders rose roughly 25% from about 298 million to 374 million cases[^increase_in_cases]​. Studies also show that mental health disorders hit differently across age groups and genders. Young adults ages 18 to 25 in the U.S have the highest rate of experiencing any mental health concerns (30.6%) compared to adults aged 26 to 49 years, and the highest rate of serious mental illness (9.7%)[^more_young]. We see a similiar dispropotionate affect in gender where females are diagnosed with serious mental health conditions at higher rates than males, 7% to 4.2%, respectively[^more_female].

While these numbers are alarming in and of themselves, they may be even higher as many people with mental illnesses go undiagnosed. This is bad for those who are ill, but also for the area as a whole which in turn doesn't get the attention and support that it deserves. 

## The Treatment Gap

To make matters worse, as many as 50% of those diagonsed with specific mental health conditions does not receive any care[^treatment_gap].

## Heyday in a nutshell

Heyday is on a mission to help people steer clear of mental health disorders by enabling conversational self-care when times are tough, before they turn into a medical condition.
